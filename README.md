## Validation Feedback
In some cases you want to show validation messages on an attribute or association, but you cannot use the default validation message, for example for some custom widgets or when you want to show the validation not directly underneath the field. You can of course build a workaround for this and add helper attributes to show the validation. This is not needed by using this widget. Just select the attribute or association you want to track and show the widget anywhere on the page.

## Features
- Show validation message that is triggered for an attribute
- Show validation message that is triggered for an association
- Different styling for the validation feedback, "success", "primary", "danger", "default", "info" or "warning"


## Usage
- Add widget anywhere on the page where needed
- Select attribute or association to track
- Use the validation message as you are used to

## Known Limitations
When an assocition is used, the selectable objects are mandatory. However, you can just return an empty list.
